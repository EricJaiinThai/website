title: List of relevant GIS journals
permalink: /journals/
---

We are maintaining a list of interesting journals, that can be considered when having a publication ready for submission.

Some of the journals are not fundamentally GIS journals, but they have been known to publish relevant GIS papers and to provide a peer-review of high quality.

The impact factor can be checked (inside the campus or using a VPN) [here](http://admin-apps.webofknowledge.com/JCR/JCR). The search system is *very* picky. It's probably easier to search by ISSN or to first find the exact name [here](http://admin-apps.webofknowledge.com/JCR/JCR?RQ=TITLES_FULL) using the search function of your browser.
