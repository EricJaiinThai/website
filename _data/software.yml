- name: GDAL/OGR
  webpage: http://www.gdal.org
  description: GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single raster abstract data model and vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It also comes with a variety of useful commandline utilities for data translation and processing.

- name: Triangle
  webpage: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html
  description: Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay triangulations, conforming Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and high-quality triangular meshes. The latter can be generated with no small or large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis.
