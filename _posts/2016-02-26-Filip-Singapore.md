Our PhD researcher [Filip Biljecki](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/biljecki) has spent several weeks in Singapore on a research visit at the [Singapore Land Authority (SLA)](https://www.sla.gov.sg) working on the SLA's 3D National Topographic Mapping Project. The project involves the production of the island-wide 3D city model. The model is being constructed with both the airborne and terrestrial techniques, resulting in an accurate and very detailed 3D city model stored in CityGML. Some of the topics which Filip has explored are the geometric quality of the models, and how to leverage its usability.

During the research visit, Filip has also visited several institutions where he has held [presentations](http://www.fcl.ethz.ch/event/fcl-lunch-talk-recent-developments-in-3d-city-modelling/) about our group and Dutch experiences in 3D city modelling. For instance, he has visited the [Infocomm Development Authority (iDA) of Singapore](https://www.ida.gov.sg), [Singapore-ETH centre](http://www.fcl.ethz.ch/about/sec/) / [Future Cities Lab](http://www.fcl.ethz.ch) at the [Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE)](http://www.create.edu.sg), [National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://www.nus.edu.sg), [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](http://www.sutd.edu.sg), and the [University of Technology Malaysia (UTM)](http://www.utm.my) in the Malaysian city of Johor Bahru. Finally, he has also participated in the [Global Young Scientists Summit (GYSS 2016)](http://www.nrf.gov.sg/gyss-one-north/gyss@one-north-2016), attended by [Dr Tony Tan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Tan), the President of the Republic of Singapore, and several Nobel Prize, Fields Medal, and Turing Award laureates.

A few photos of Filip's fruitful stay in Singapore are included below.
