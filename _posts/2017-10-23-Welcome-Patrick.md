Patrick Janssen has just joined our research group as an external associate-professor.

Patrick is already an associate-professor at the [Department of Architecture of the National University of Singapore](https://www.arch.nus.edu.sg), and this position (for a duration of 5 years) will allow us to strengthen our links with Singapore (where [great projects about 3D geoinformation](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/programmes/virtual-singapore) are taking place) and Patrick's links to the Netherlands.

Welcome Patrick, we hope to see you often in Delft!
