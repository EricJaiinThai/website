Anna Labetski has just joined our research group as a PhD student.
She will be working on the ERC project [Urban modelling in higher dimensions]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/umnd), and her topic of research will be the generalisation of 3D city models (not only buildings, but also other city objects such as bridges, the terrain, etc).

Anna has a degree in Human Geography and History from the University of Toronto, and an MSc in Geospatial analysis from the University College London.
Her MSc thesis was entitled "Modelling cycling risk of killed or seriously injured accidents based on roads attributes -- London, United Kingdom"

Welcome Anna, and good luck!
