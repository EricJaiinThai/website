Sangmin Kim has just joined our research group as a postdoc. 
His topic of research will be 3D land administration and cadastral system (not only above ground buildings, but also underground architecture and civil infrastructures).
Sangmin completed his PhD at the SCSI lab ([Yonsei University](http://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/)) in Korea. 
The topic of his PhD was “Design and Implementation of 3D Underground Cadastral System in Korea”. 
His research interests are in database modeling and 3D building modelling with focus on the real-world implementation of 3D land administration and cadastral system.

Welcome Sangmin, and good luck for the coming year!
