21 participants succesfully finished our 3D city modelling course that is part of the [2016 series of e-learning courses from EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/education/current). 

This is the first year we gave this course and we were pleased to see that many students actively participated in the online discussion forum. We received some very good submission for the final assignment. And based on the overwhelmingly positve  feedback from the participants we have some good ideas for making the course even better next year.

Until next year!
