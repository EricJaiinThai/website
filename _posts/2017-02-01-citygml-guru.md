Because we were saddened by the general state of the CityGML websites, we have now taken over the official domain: [www.citygml.org](https://www.citygml.org).

<a href="https://www.citygml.org"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2017/citygmlguru.png"/></a>

We currently have, among others, the following: 

  - several [sample datasets](https://www.citygml.org/samplefiles/) (included different examples of the different primitives)
  - [a list of a openly available cities in CityGML](https://www.citygml.org/3dcities/), and those in other formats too
  - [a list of software that are CityGML v2.0 compatible](https://www.citygml.org/3dcities/)
  - [the complete schema of CityGML, *browsable*](https://www.citygml.org/schemas/doc-complete/citygml)

Anyone who also loves CityGML is more than welcome to contribute to the site by submitting new content and/or fixing errors.
We are particularly looking for new software, and a more exhaustive list of [ongoing developments](https://www.citygml.org/ongoingdev/).

The [source code is publicly available and hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/tudelft3d/website-citygml), and if you want to contribute please visit [this page](https://www.citygml.org/contribute/).

Cheers,
The gurus of CityGML
