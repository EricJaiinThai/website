We are very proud that our team member [Hugo Ledoux](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux/) will continue his work as Associated Professor in our group.
Our university appointed Hugo in this new position because of his excellent research in which he combines computational geometry, 3D GIS and software programming.
With this unique approach Hugo has successfully developed algorithms and methods to ensure that 3D geoinformation can be used by all the specialists who need it.
He is active in many projects that benefit from his approach.
