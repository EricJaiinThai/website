    <p>Starting from October 14, we will hold every 2 weeks talks about one aspect of 3D geoinformation.
    Either one staff of the group presents their latest results, or we invite someone from another university or from a company to present their results and/or latest developments.</p>
    <p>These will be usually Fridays at 11:00--12:00, but look at the [schedule]({{ "/3dtalks/" | | prepend: site.baseurl }}")</p>
    <p>Everyone is welcome to join, no need to register, just come to the room advertised.</p>
