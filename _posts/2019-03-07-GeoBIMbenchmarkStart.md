The 2019 Scientific Initiative funded by [ISPRS](https://www.isprs.org/) and [EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/) has started!

The project will investigate available technical solutions for the integration and interoperability of data concerning 3D geoinformation and 3D building information models (BIM).
This is the first project that will provide insight into the **state of implementations of the open standards** in the 3D geo and BIM domain, also identifying remaining issues.

Read the full description of the project in the [GeoBIM benchmark website](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/) and follow the activities!
