His reseach are part of the research project [SIMs3D](http://www.sims3d.net).

Abdoulaye completed his PhD at the [LIRIS lab](http://liris.cnrs.fr) (Universit√© de Lyon) in France. 
The topic of his PhD was "Application of the Combinatorial Maps to Geometric and Semantic Modeling of 3D Buildings". His research interests are in computational geometry and 3D modelling with 
focus on spatial relationships (topology) and semantic information recovering. 

Welcome Abdou, and good luck!
