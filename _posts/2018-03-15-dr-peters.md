On Wednesday 14 March 2018 (International Ï€ Day), [Ravi Peters](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/rypeters/) successfully defended his PhD thesis at TU Delft.

Ravi's PhD thesis is entitled *Geographical point cloud modelling with the 3D medial axis transform* ([PDF freely available](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/rypeters/pdfs/thesis_web.pdf)).

We are also excited that Ravi will continue to work with the group as a Postdoc!

Congratulations Dr Peters ðŸŽ‰
