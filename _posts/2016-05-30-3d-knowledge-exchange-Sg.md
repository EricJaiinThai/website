On Friday 27 May we have organised a workshop at TU Delft to discuss experiences and collaboration in 3D geoinformation between the Netherlands and Singapore. We have welcomed representatives of four agencies of the Singapore Government: [Singapore Land Authority (SLA)](http://www.sla.gov.sg), [Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (iDA)](http://www.ida.gov.sg), [Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)](http://www.ura.gov.sg/), and the [National Research Foundation (NRF)](http://www.nrf.gov.sg).

Experts from several Dutch institutions and companies were present as well to convey their expertise and current work: [City of Amsterdam](http://www.amsterdam.nl), [City of the Hague](http://www.denhaag.nl), [City of Rotterdam](http://www.rotterdam.nl), [Tygron](http://www.tygron.com), [ESRI](http://esri.nl), [Future Insight](http://www.futureinsight.nl/en/), and [Kadaster](https://www.kadaster.nl/).
