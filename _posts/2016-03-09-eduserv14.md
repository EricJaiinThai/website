The [2016 series of e-learning courses from EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/education/current) has just kicked of with a pre-course seminar that was hosted by the Faculty of Geography and Regional Studies, University of Warsaw, Poland, from 7th to 8th March 2016. During the seminar, background material of four e-learning courses has been presented to the participants. Our PhD candidate Ravi Peters gave a lecture on 3D city modelling, a course that is organised by our group. The seminar was well attended.

Starting from April 18th 2016 we will host the e-learning part of the course. In the e-learning part the participant will need to create a valid LOD1 3D city model fully automatically and in CityGML 2.0.
