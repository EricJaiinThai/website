The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGCÂ®) has recently released the results of the CityGML Quality Interoperability Experiment (QIE) as a public Engineering Report, the [PDF can be downloaded there](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=68821).

The report is the result of several universities, organisations and companies working together in 2014 and 2015 to define data quality requirements for a general CityGML data specification, to create recommended implementation guidance for CityGML data, and to provide a suite of tools to carry out quality assurance on CityGML data. The CityGML QIE improves the interoperability of CityGML data by removing some ambiguities from the current standard, and formally defining data quality requirements for a general CityGML data standard.
