In the week of 20-24 March 2017, together with [Geonovum](http://www.geonovum.nl), we have hosted the [Technical and Planning Committee Meeting](http://www.opengeospatial.org/event/1703tc) of the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](http://www.opengeospatial.org).

The TPC meetings are quarterly conferences in which [OGC members](http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/members), which are organised in several working and domain groups, convene to discuss the development of standards and other topics of interest.

The TPC meeting in Delft was very well attended with more than 200 attendees visiting dozens of [sessions](http://www.opengeospatial.org/events/1703tcagenda). Besides hosting the event, our group was involved in giving presentations in different working and domain groups, such as the [CityGML SWG](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/citygmlswg) and [3DIM DWG](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/3dimdwg), and our associate professor [Dr Hugo Ledoux](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux/) was the [keynote speaker of the opening plenary](https://speakerdeck.com/hugoledoux/how-useful-are-current-3d-city-models).

The conference was also accompanied by social events. In the traditional Monday's Ice Breaker event, the conference attendees were welcomed in the historic Delft City Hall by [Mrs Marja van Bijsterveldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marja_van_Bijsterveldt), the mayor of the City of Delft and former Minister of Education, Culture and Science in the Dutch Government.
