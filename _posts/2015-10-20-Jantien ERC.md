Jantien Stoter (professor 3D Geoinformation, Department of Urbanism) was awarded an ERC Starting Grant (from the European Research Council, [ERC](http://erc.europa.eu/starting-grants) of 1.5 million euros for a five-year research project. She won the award for her research proposal ?Urban modeling in higher dimensions?.

Geographic data about urban objects (buildings, roads) is needed to monitor and control the processes within modern urban areas (noise, flooding, energy demand-supply). As these processes occur in 3D, urban applications require 3D data and each application requires its own
specific semantic and geometric level of detail (LoD) of the 3D data. The scientific challenge of Jantien?s project is that it requires
enormous efforts to collect and transform 3D data to make it suitable for a specific application. The project will develop a 4D data model
that captures application specific LoDs of urban objects as additional dimension to the three spatial ones (i.e. 3D+LoD). This will result in
a fundamental solution for providing 3D data at application specific LoDs and it will solve the current problem of independently acquired
and stored LoDs of a 3D urban model.

ERC Starting Grants aim to support up-and-coming research leaders. The scheme targets promising researchers who have the proven potential of becoming independent research leaders in Europe. It will support the creation of excellent new research teams.

On 30th of September the initiative [Breakthrough 3D NL](http://www.geonovum.nl/onderwerpen/3d-doorbraak) organised a 3D symposium in the Infoversum, Groningen, together with the university of Groningen. Jantien Stoter from our group represents science in this initiative. Almost 200 people enjoyed the nice 3D visualisation capabilities of the Infoversum. Many 3D applications in the area of Groningen were presented (like the virtual inventory of hunebedden and Earthquake prediction tools). In addition, several 3DBreakthrough-working groups gave updates about their ambitions and progress. The presentations as well as a short report will soon become available via the [Geonovum website](http://www.geonovum.nl/nieuws/inspireer-en-laat-je-inspireren-op-het-3d-doorbraak-symposium-30-september)
