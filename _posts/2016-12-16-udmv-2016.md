Following the Eurographics Workshop on Urban Data Modelling and Visualisation (UDMV) hosted by our group in Delft in [2015](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/events/udmv2015/), this year we had the pleasure of participating in the new (4th) edition of UDMV.

The [UDMV 2016](http://events.ulg.ac.be/udmv2016) was held in Liège, Belgium on 8 December 2016.
It was organised by the [Department of Geomatics at the University of Liège](http://www.geo.ulg.ac.be/cms/index.php?page=presentation_unit_fr).

The workshop was attended by participants from several European countries, and it included the presentations of 14 [papers](http://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/2631130), resulting in fruitful discussions.

Our group continued to be involved in the workshop in different ways: the keynote speaker of the event was Hugo Ledoux, and the programme co-chair was Filip Biljecki.<br />
