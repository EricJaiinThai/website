A new paper has been published in IJGIS:

Boeters, R., Arroyo Ohori, K., Biljecki, F., and Zlatanova, S. (2015). Automatically enhancing CityGML LOD2 models with a corresponding indoor geometry. International Journal of Geographical Information Science.<br/>
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2015.1072201">DOI: 10.1080/13658816.2015.1072201</a>

The paper deals with the following:

* Definition of LOD2+: indoor geometry with an LOD corresponding to LOD2 (CityGML).
* A method to automatically generate LOD2+ data from models with an exterior geometry.
* Tests with real-world data: we have generated the LOD2+ of Rotterdam, from the CityGML dataset Rotterdam 3D.
* Use case: calculating the net internal area of buildings, and validation with real world data from government records.


The code (lod2plus) supporting this work can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/lod2plus">Github repository of our group</a>.
