Last week was the [2018 3D GeoInfo Conference](https://3dgeoinfo2018.nl/), and we had a great week!

We began by hosting the [pre-conference workshop](https://3dgeoinfo2018.nl/workshop.html) on the *Automated reconstruction of 3D City Models and using them in urban applications*. It was a lovely Sunday with a great group of people!

On Monday and Tuesday we joined the [Geo Delft Conferences 2018](https://www.tudelft.nl/geodelft2018/) and helped in organising the 3D GeoInfo Conference with Jantien Stoter, of our group, co-chairing with Mila Koeva from the University of Twente. It was a jam-packed but educational two days.
Conference proceedings and presentations can be accessed [here](https://3dgeoinfo2018.nl/programme.html). Thank you to all presenters and organisers! ðŸ˜ƒ
