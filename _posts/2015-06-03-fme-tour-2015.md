We have attended the FME World Tour 2015 at the Dierenpark (zoo) in Amersfoort (Netherlands). The event was organised by [Vicrea](http://www.vicrea.nl).

Filip Biljecki from our group has presented how we use FME in education and research. For instance, we use it in error propagation research to compute the volume of a large number of solids, and our [MSc Geomatics](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl/) students use it to generate 3D city models from public datasets.

We thank Vicrea for organising this interesting event at an interesting location.
