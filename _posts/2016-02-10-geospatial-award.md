We are proud and honoured to have been awarded the [Geospatial World Leadership Award for Research Institution of the Year 2015](http://geospatialworld.net/News/View.aspx?id=33263_Article&utm_content=buffer3ad98&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer). 

The award, which we share with other research groups at the TU Delft in the field (such as [GIS-technology](http://www.gdmc.nl) and the [Geoscience & Remote Sensing](http://www.citg.tudelft.nl/over-faculteit/afdelingen/geoscience-and-remote-sensing/)), recognises our crucial role in geomatics and our contributions to the fields of 3D geoinformation, among others.

The award will be presented during the [Geospatial World Forum](http://geospatialworldforum.org) in a few month in Rotterdam.
