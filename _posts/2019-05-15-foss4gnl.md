We are happy to host the [FOSS4GNL 2019 conference](https://foss4g.nl/), which is the Dutch Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial Conference held annually.

This year it'll be at TU Delft (at [BK-City](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment/about-the-faculty/contact-and-map/)) on Thursday 20 June 2019.

While many of the talks will be in Dutch, there will always be at least one track (the most technical one) that will be entirely in English.

We invite you to register and you to propose a talk at [foss4g.nl](https://foss4g.nl/)

See you on 20 June!
