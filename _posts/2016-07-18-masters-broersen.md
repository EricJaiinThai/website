On June 22, Tom Broersen successfully defended his MSc thesis work (in the programme [MSc Geomatics at TU Delft](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl)). 
Congratulations!

He worked on the automatic identification of water courses by using only the AHN3 dataset.
His work will significantly improve the current semi-manual process that uses different 2D datasets and aerial imagery.
