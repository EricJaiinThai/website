In this [report](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/pdfs/18_georeferencing.pdf), Abdoulaye Diakité studies how the geographic coordinates of a construction project should be integrated in its 3D model such that the information is kept in the context of a GIS application.
The study covers the case of BIMs designed using the Autodesk Revit software and exported as IFC.
Furthermore, the report describes the developed [web service interface](https://github.com/tudelft3d/IfcLocator) which allows to visualise the geographic position associated with an IFC file and correct its Latitude/Longitude by picking a new location.
The tool is based on the Cesium project allowing to visualise the process on a 3D globe.
