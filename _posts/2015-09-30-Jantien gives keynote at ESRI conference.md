At the ESRI conference NL on 24th of September Jantien Stoter (chair of our group) gave a keynote about the lack of good and appropriate 3D data necessary to make 3D applications mainstream technologies. Although 3D technologies have matured and are part of our daily lives (TV, movies, games), geo-information is often still limited to 2D. This reduction causes the loss of important information. Jantien elaborated on what is needed to also make 3D technologies mainstream in the geo-domain. The speech was recored and is available at the [ESRI website](http://esri.nl/evenementen/esri-gis-conferentie/video/dag-2).
