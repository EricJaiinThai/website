A group of Geomatics students visited the exhibition of the Prinsenhof museum [“Delft op de Kaert”](http://prinsenhof-delft.nl/en/agenda/20-tentoonstellingen/198-delft-op-de-kaart) yesterday. Early this year the students were invited by the museum to demonstrate current technologies for 3D reconstructions and realistic visualisation. The invitation was accepted with enthusiasm by the lectures of the course GEO1004 ‘3D modelling for the built environment’. In cooperation with the museum six student assignments were defined: [Ancient fortifications of the Delft](https://www.facebook.com/MuseumHetPrinsenhof/videos/vb.393605697333974/1035294739831730/?type=2&theater), Realistic visualisation of Paardenmarkt, Walk through the city with Cyclomedia images, Laser scanning of interior of the Prinsenhof, 1654 gunpowder explosion in Minecraft and Prinsenhof in the time. The videos with the student works are to be seen at the videowall of the exhibition. The exhibition is open until 28th of June.
