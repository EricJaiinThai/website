On 1st of November, as part of [Geo users Festival](https://www.geonovum.nl/onderwerpen/3d-geo-informatie/nieuws/1-november-geo-gebruikersfestival-2017-0), our group had the pleasure to organise the '3D IMGeo: reconstruct it yourself!' workshop. We were glad to have a full room of participants. 

Jantien Stoter was the coordinator, while Ravi Peters gave a presentation regarding 3D IMGeo's capabilities and [3dfier](http://www.github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier), our software for creating 3D datasets by combining 2D data and elevation information. We have developed this software in collaboration with our partners (Kadster, NWO, AMS).
Ravi and Stelios Vitalis assisted the participants through the process of creating and visualising 3D models on their computers.

You may find the presentation material [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2017/3Dfier-DIY.pdf).

We thank everyone for joining and hope to see people creating and sharing their own 3D data.
