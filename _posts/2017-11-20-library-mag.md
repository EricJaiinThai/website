The [TU Delft library](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/) chose our research group as an example of best practices for publishing software as open-source and papers as open! 

They made a [very nice article](http://www.onlinemagazine.library.tudelft.nl/?p=2060).


We are happy that our efforts to make our software and papers freely available were recognised ðŸ˜Š, and we hope it'll motivate others to imitate us.
