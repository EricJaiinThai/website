The deadline for the [UDMV 2015](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/events/udmv2015) workshop has been extended to 20 July. Please find the 2nd call for papers on the [website of the event](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/events/udmv2015), or as a [PDF](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/events/udmv2015/UDMV2015-CfP.pdf).

Further, the [UDMV 2015 point cloud contest](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/events/udmv2015/contest.html) has just been announced. It is aimed at researchers in the LiDAR, 3D modelling, and visualisation domains, but we also welcome a wide variety of other topics. Please find more information at the [webpage of the contest](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/events/udmv2015/contest.html). Note that the submission of abstracts is due on 16 October, and that the participation does not mandate attending the workshop. It is open to everyone.

The [3rd Eurographics Workshop on Urban Data Modelling and Visualisation](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/events/udmv2015) is a multi-disciplinary event that bridges 3D GIS and computer graphics, with two successful editions organised in the past (in France and in Spain). It will be hosted on 23 November by the [3D geoinformation group at TU Delft](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl).

We are looking forward to your valuable submissions. <br/>
