In November and December 2018, Kjersti Moe from [Vermessung AVT in Tyrol](https://www.avt.at/home.html), Austria is visiting our 3D geoinformation in Delft within the framework of the [MCSA VOLTA](https://volta.fbk.eu) Project.

Amongst the overall aims for the project are the development of new methodologies to derive accurate geometric information from images, as well as automatic classification and understanding of (2D and 3D) geospatial data.
The VOLTA projects promotes intersectoral collaboration and sharing of knowledge between research and market through staff exchange.
 
Vermessung [AVT](www.avt.at) is an Austrian surveying company, offering a wide palette of services and products, including aerial image accquisition and photogrammetrically derived products.
During her stay, Kjersti will work together with the 3D geoinformation group on the development of 3D products.
 
The VOLTA project is funded by the EU Marie Curie RISE actions.
