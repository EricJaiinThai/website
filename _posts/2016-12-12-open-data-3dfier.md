In the past several months, together with [Kadaster](https://www.kadaster.nl), we have been busy developing [3dfier](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier), an open-source software to generate LOD1 datasets from 2D and elevation datasets.
The software outputs CityGML and OBJ.

We have generated a set of [sample data]({{ site.baseurl }}/opendata/3dfier/) of a few cities in the Netherlands.

In future we plan to add new datasets, so feel free to bookmark the page and check it for updates.
