Sisi Zlatanova has accepted a position in the [faculty of the Built Environment, at the University of New South Wales](https://www.be.unsw.edu.au/) in Sydney, Australia, and has started earlier this week.

Sisi was part of our group since its beginning on 2015-01-01, and her work on the modelling of the indoor environment will be missed.

[Her new homepage is there](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-sisi-zlatanova), if you need to get in touch with her.

The best of luck Down Under Sisi!
