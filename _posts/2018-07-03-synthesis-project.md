During the first year of the Geomatics master our students work on so-called synthesis projects. In these projects students work together in groups of 5 to 6 students in order to carry out a research. often in collaboration with third parties from government or industry. This year our group had the pleasure to supervise two synthesis projects.

The first group created a complete [web application](http://skyview.bk.tudelft.nl) from scratch that enables us to compute the skyview-factor (ie. the relative amount of visible sky for a given geographic location) for any point in the municipality of The Hague, who was also their client.

The second group worked with with the [Floriade 2022 project](https://floriade.com) and built a complete C++ software that is able to automatically reconstruct building meshes from a set images acquired by drone or by handheld camera. Have a look at their [poster]({{"/pdfs/synthesis-floriade-poster.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl}}) or their [github repository](https://github.com/Natasja1992/3d_floriade) if you want to know more.

We were impressed by the hard work of all students and hope to see them back for a graduation project.
