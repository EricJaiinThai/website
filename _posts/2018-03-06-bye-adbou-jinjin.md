Abdoulaye Diakité (postdoc) and Jinjin Yan (PhD student) have both left our research group recently: they are joining the newly formed group of [Sisi Zlatanova at UNSW](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-sisi-zlatanova) in Sydney, Australia! Abdoulaye will continue as a postdoc, and Jinjin will finish his PhD there.

The best of luck to you both, we hope you won't miss the cold rain of Delft too much.
