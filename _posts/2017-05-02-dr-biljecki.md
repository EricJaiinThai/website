On Monday 1 May 2017, [Filip Biljecki](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/biljecki/) successfully defended his PhD thesis at TU Delft.
Because both his work in the last 4.5 years and his thesis were judged "exceptional", he also graduated *cum laude*, which is awarded to less than 5% of PhD theses in the Netherlands.

Filip's PhD thesis is entitled *Level of detail in 3D city models* ([PDF freely available](http://doi.org/b463)).

Congratulations Dr Biljecki ðŸŽ‰
