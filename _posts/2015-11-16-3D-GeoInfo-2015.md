Our staff members [Ken Arroyo Ohori](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/) and [Filip Biljecki](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/biljecki/) attended the [Joint International Geoinformation Conference 2015](http://www.geoinfo.utm.my/jointgeoinfo2015/), held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The conference was organised by the [Universiti Teknologi Malaysia](http://www.k-economy.utm.my/3dgis/), and it comprised several tracks, of which the most relevant to us is the [10th 3D Geoinfo conference 2015](http://www.geoinfo.utm.my/jointgeoinfo2015/3dgeoinfo.html). 3D GeoInfo is the flagship conference of the 3D GIS community, and in 2007 it was organised in Delft. The output of the conference tracks is published in three proceedings:

* [ISPRS Archives vol. XL-2/W4](http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-2-W4/index.html)

* [ISPRS Annals vol. II-2/W4](http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-2-W2/index.html)

* Springer book [Advances in 3D Geoinformation](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319256894), part of the series Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography, which contains selected papers of the 3D GeoInfo track. The book is in press, and it will be published in the coming weeks.

Our group contributed with 2 papers:
