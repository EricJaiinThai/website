Our PhD candidate [Filip Biljecki](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/biljecki) participated in the [13th ISPRS Summer School](http://summerschool.acrs2015.org/) held in in Quezon City, Philippines. The School was organised by the [University of the Philippines](http://www.up.edu.ph), the [Philippine Geosciences and Remote Sensing Society](http://philgrss.org), and the [ISPRS Student Consortium](http://www.isprs-studentconsortium.org). The topic of the event was "Using Geospatial Technologies for Natural Resources Management", and it was collocated with the [36th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing](http://www.acrs2015.org). It contained lectures and workshops on a series of topics related to remote sensing and geoinformation.
