Today, the Dutch national newspaper "De Volkskrant" published an [article](http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/het-kadaster-wordt-driedimensionaal~a4262482/) about the first deed that will be registered with a 3D visualisation of rights at the Land Registry of the Netherlands' Kadaster. The article is based on an interview with Jantien Stoter. She is involved in this project.
The combined structure of the new city hall and the underground railway station of Delft, including the railway and underground bicycle parking place is the first to be registered in this way. This is a milestone in the history of cadastral registration. This cadastral registration of an interactive, 3D visualisation of multi-level property rights is unique.
