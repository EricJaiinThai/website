Tom Commandeur has recently started a researcher in our research group, he will be mostly working on our [software to construct 3D city models](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier), and will improve it so that we can automatically use it to reconstruct the whole of the Netherlands in 3D.
We aim at having a full 3DBGT datasets in the coming months.
This will be done in collaboration with the [Kadaster](http://www.kadaster.nl).

Tom finalised in the beginning of 2012 a Msc Geomatics at the TU Delft with a [thesis on automated reconstruction of 3D city models](http://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:c0c665f7-0254-42c6-895b-cb59acc079f2/?collection=research). 
Since then he has worked as a Geo-Information specialist and software developer in a commercial company applying HydroInformatics in solutions for the Dutch waterboards. 

Welcome Tom!
