This week we had the pleasure of hosting the pre-course seminar of the [2017 series of e-learning courses from EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/education/current). 
During the seminar, 4 lecturers presented on the topics of 3D city modelling (Jantien Stoter & Ravi Peters from our group), oblique photogrammetry (Fabio Remondino), synthetic aperture radar (Olaf Hellwich) and terrestial point clouds for forest modelling (Liang Xinlian).

People from throughout Europe travelled to Delft to attend the lectures. The audience was mix of academics and people from industry and mapping agencies.

We are very satisfied with how this turned out, and we hope the participants also enjoyed their stay with us.

Starting from next week the e-learning part of the courses will take place.
