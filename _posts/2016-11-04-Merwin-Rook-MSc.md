On 4 November 2016, Merwin Rook completed the MSc Geomatics programme with the defence of his MSc thesis <i>Automatic thematic and semantic classification of 3D city models</i>.
The work has been carried out in our [3D Geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl).

The goal of the research was to develop a method that automatically detects features in "plain" 3D city models, enriching them with semantic and thematic information. The work contributes to the creation of CityGML models from existing 3D models stored in computer graphic formats.

The thesis will be available shortly at the [TU Delft repository](http://repository.tudelft.nl).

The work was also published as a conference paper (open access) at the recent [Joint 3D Athens Conference 2016](http://3dathens2016.gr/site/):
