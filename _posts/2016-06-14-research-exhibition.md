The [TU Delft Research Exhibition 2016](http://www.dig-it.tudelft.nl/#projects) was held on 2 June 2016.
The aim was to connect researchers to the general public and companies, and this year more than 380 visitors from more than 125 companies visited the exhibition.

We were honoured to having been chosen, as only 20 research projects were on display.
To help us communicate with the public, the university prepared visual and interactive settings. 
In our case, we had that cartoon below, and an *illuminated* 3D printed model of Delft (that was created automatically with [our software](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier)).

We will also be present next year, but this time it will be bigger: 175 research projects will be displayed, and they expect 4000+ visitors over 3 days.
