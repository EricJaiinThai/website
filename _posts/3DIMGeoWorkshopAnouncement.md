On 1st of November at the [Geo users Festival](https://www.geonovum.nl/sites/default/files/GGF17webversie1.pdf) we will organise a workshop in which participants will create their own 3D IMGeo data from 2D IMGeo data and a point cloud (AHN).
For this automated 3D data reconstruction, our group has developed open source software [software](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier) in collaboration with our partners.
The output can be written to IMGeo 2.1.1, CityGML, OBJ and [CityJSON](http://www.cityjson.org/en/0.3/)
Unfortunately, the Festival is fully booked. But the software (including tutorials) can be found [here](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier/wiki)
