If you have worked with large GIS datasets, I am sure you will agree: ’broken’ GIS polygons are everywhere. The problem is that whether a polygon is broken depends on the polygons themselves, the format they are stored in, your computer and operating system, the software you are using them in, and what you want to do with them.

prepair — pronounced ‘pee-repair’ as in ‘polygon repair’ — solves all issues automatically, generating polygons that always conform to the international standards [ISO 19107](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26012) and [OGC Simple Features](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa) quickly, robustly and without moving any points. It is available freely under the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) license (or a commercial license if that is too restrictive for you).
