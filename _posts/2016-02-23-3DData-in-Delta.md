This week the independent student newspaper of TU Delft (Delta) published an [interview](http://delta.tudelft.nl/uploads/delta.tudelft.nl/delta_articles_editions/792/pdf/Delta_10_def_LR.pdf) with Jantien Stoter about our research on 3D data and how this has evolved over the years. Our automatically-created 3D model of Delft (which we can create for the whole country) is on the cover.
