A new paper has been published in IJGIS:

Biljecki, F., Heuvelink, G. B. M., Ledoux, H., and Stoter, J. (2015). Propagation of positional error in 3D GIS: estimation of the solar irradiation of building roofs. International Journal of Geographical Information Science.<br/>
<a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2015.1073292">DOI: 10.1080/13658816.2015.1073292</a>

The paper deals with the following:

* Extension of the error propagation theory to 3D GIS
* A method to determine the propagation of error with procedurally generated (synthetic) 3D city models
* Development of a CityGML-compliant software to estimate the insolation of rooftops of buildings
* Investigation of the propagation of error in the estimation of the solar irradiation

The code (Solar3Dcity) supporting this work can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/Solar3Dcity">Github repository of our group</a>.
