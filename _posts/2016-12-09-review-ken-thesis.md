We were very happy---and surprised---to see that the [Journal of Spatial Science](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tjss20/current) (made by [Mohsen Kalantari](http://www.csdila.unimelb.edu.au/people/saeid-kalantari-soltanieh.html)) has published a review of the PhD thesis of [Ken Arroyo Ohori](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken), who [defended earlier this year his PhD work](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/news/2016/04/07/ken-phd.html) in our group.
Surprised because we do not often see reviews of PhD theses, that section is, we believe, mostly reserved for the review of books.

The review, available [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14498596.2016.1225489), is very positive:

    it pushes the boundary of existing theories in 3D geographic modelling. It brings the knowledge-base of the spatial sciences to a new level. Particularly, the early chapter on conceptualising higher dimensions of geographic phenomena is significant for the spatial sciences.

and even states that it could be used as a textbook:

     I strongly recommend the book to those who are undertaking research in 3D and spatiotemporal information. Also, the book has the potential to be used as a reference textbook for teaching.

The thesis released into the public domain using the CC0 code, and is [freely available online](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/thesis/).

For those interested in how it was written (ie the details about LaTeX), Ken wrote a [nice blog post](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/2016/04/02/my-latex-thesis-workflow.html).
