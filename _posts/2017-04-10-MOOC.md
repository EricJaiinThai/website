The [TU Delft Department of Urbanism](http://www.urbanism.tudelft.nl) is organising an edX course [Urban Design for the Public Good: Dutch Urbanism](https://www.edx.org/course/urban-design-public-good-dutch-urbanism-delftx-urbanismx).

We are pleased that we have contributed to one modules of the course, which is focused on Modelling in Urbanism. 
Besides preparing the assignments, our postdoc [Abdoulaye Diakit√©](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/adiakite/) made an excellent job with a nice introductory video to 3D GIS.
