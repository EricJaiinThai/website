This is the time of the year when the [MSc Geomatics](http://geomatics.tudelft.nl) students are starting their graduation work.
They will work individually on a topic of their choice for 9 months.
This year, we're glad that several of them (8/14!) have chosen a topic related to 3D geoinformation:

  1. Broersen, Tom: *Automatic identification of water courses from AHN3*
  1. Fichtner, Florian: *Subdivision of 3D space to support 3D indoor localization*
  1. Heeres, Erik: *Creating an automatic, robust and scalable workflow for the creation of the 3D BAG*
  1. Kate, Jan ten: *Mapping the nuisance caused by music festivals by using 3D modelling*
  1. Koopman, Martijn: *3D Path-finding in a voxelized model of indoor environments*
  1. Nagelkerke, Tim: *3D Indoor Navigation: Pursuing individuals in motion*
  1. Rodenberg, Olivier: *3D navigation using an octree data structure*
  1. Rook, Merwin: *Automatic thematic and semantic labelling of 3D city models*

Good luck to all of them, and we'll keep you posted on their progress.
