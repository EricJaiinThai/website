<h1>Task 4</h1>
<h3>Options for <strong>conversion</strong> (software and procedural) (both <strong>IFC to CityGML</strong> and <strong>CityGML to IFC</strong>)</h3>

The participants should apply the tested conversion procedure to the IFC (to be converted to CityGML) or to the CityGML files (to be converted to IFC).

Note: it is very welcome if the same procedure is used for all the IFC files or for all the CityGML files, eventually pointing out the differences in the comments sections (needed settings, needed time, etc.), so that an assessment about the differences in the various cases can be done (georeferenced files vs non-georeferenced files, big files vs small files).

**The task will require, approximately, <mark>TIME</mark>, to be performed and deliver the required results.**

You can choose the software you are more confident with.

A part of the investigation regards also the performances of the software in the used computer. Therefore, as important part of the results, participants are also asked to declare the details of the used computer for the tests, and to **check the (approximated) required processing time for each step.**

For these data were not affected by third factors, participants are asked to **close all the unnecessary processes, software and tools in the computer during the test**.

<ol>
	<li>
		The employed workflow should be described:
		<ul>
			<li>In the case that you are using an existing tool, please describe in detail all the steps and settings performed to convert the model, in every case when a completely automated procedure is not working.</li>
			<li>In the case you are proposing a conversion procedure, please attach some documentation about it (papers, reports, web pagesâ€¦) and describe in detail all the necessary steps and settings, to properly perform and, eventually, customize the procedure for obtaining a suitable result.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
