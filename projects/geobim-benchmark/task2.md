You can choose the software you are more confident with. No restrictions are given.

A part of the investigation regards also the performances of the software in the used computer.

For these data were not affected by third factors, participants are asked to **close all the unnecessary processes, software and tools in the computer during the test**.

The participants should georeference the IFC provided in a local system according to the parameters described in the corresponding georeferenced data, <mark>which are here reported</mark>:


And export the resulting georeferenced IFC.
