<h1>Benchmark events</h1>

Within the GeoBIM benchmark initiative, two open events are about to be organised:

A meeting (also web-meeting) between organisers and participants together for discussing the issues arose so far and proposing improvements to the materials and the on-going activities.

A winter school for presenting the main results and training to GeoBIM.
