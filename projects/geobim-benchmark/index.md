<h3>Reference study on software support for open standards of city and building models</h3>

This benchmark will investigate the available **technical solutions** to support research and activities related to GeoBIM, through the use of the **open standards IFC** (by buildingSMART) and **CityGML** (by OGC).  We will address the following questions:

1. What is the **support for IFC** within BIM (and other) software?
2. What options for **geo-referencing BIM** data are available?
3. What is the **support for CityGML** within GIS (and other) tools?
4. What options for **conversion (IFCâ†”CityGML)** are available?
5. What is the support of different types of **IFC geometries**?

You are invited to take part in this benchmark activity by performing one or more tasks.

		<p>Volunteers will be required to perform one or more tasks using  the tools they are familiar with, and deliver their results using the results template.</p>
		<p>At least one scientific publication co-authored by both the benchmark proponents and volunteers will be written, and final results will be published on the website.</p>
