<h1>An in-depth insight into the GeoBIM benchmark project</h1>

The investigation of the available technical solutions to support research and activities related to the GeoBIM topic is the subject of this project.

This is the first project that will provide insight into the current state of the art of standardisation in the 3D geo and BIM domain and will also identifying remaining issues.

It is a Scientific initiative funded by the [International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS)](http://www.isprs.org/) and the [European Spatial Data Research association (EuroSDR)](www.eurosdr.net).

### Objective

The main objective of the benchmark is to **provide a framework** describing the present ability of existing software tools to **use** (read and visualise, import, manage, analyse, export) CityGML and IFC models and understand their **performance** while doing so, both in terms of information loss and in terms of ability to handle large datasets.

Three aspects of this problem are examined.

Firstly, software support for the individual standards (CityGML and IFC) within their respective domains – i.e. how well is CityGML supported by GIS tools and IFC by BIM tools?

Secondly, options for IFC geo-referencing is explored, as this is a fundamental step in enabling information exchange.

Thirdly, a critical test of the available conversion procedures between CityGML and IFC (in both directions) is conducted to objectively assess and compare potential for integrated data use, starting from the same premises.

The benchmark defines specific **tasks** to test the following:

<ol>
	<li>Support for IFC within BIM software;</li>
	<li>Options for geo-referencing BIM data;</li>
	<li>Support for CityGML within GIS tools;</li>
	<li>Options for conversion (software and procedural) (both IFC to CityGML and CityGML to IFC).</li>
</ol>

External voluntary participants perform one or more tasks with the tools they are familiar with, and deliver their results in the provided results template.

Participants delivering suitable results can be cited in the benchmark website.

The scientific material regarding the used procedures/tools (papers, reports, web resources, open repositories…) will be linked in the benchmark website at the <mark>link:</mark>.

At least one scientific publication co-authored by both the benchmark proponents and participants will be written.

An intermediate **meeting** of proponents and participants will be organised to present, discuss and disseminate the intermediate results. This will provide an opportunity to present the most promising workflows identified to date, propose their replication by other participants and to discuss eventual adjustments to the test datasets or further activities or developments.

### Benchmark Data

Two datasets will be provided for each of the two standards (IFC, to be used for tasks 1,2 and 4, IFC to CityGML conversion; and CityGML, to be used for tasks 3 and 4 CityGML to IFC conversion). The simpler ones will be used to test software functionality. The more complex (larger) ones will also test the requirements in terms of computer hardware in order to support conversion. Moreover, two versions of the two IFC models will be provided:

<ul>
	<li>The first one will be georeferenced;</li>
	<li>The other one will not be georeferenced. Task 2 will focus specifically on the options for georeferencing of these models within the tested software tools.</li>
</ul>

We provide datasets from two countries: the Netherlands and Sweden; a complete description of them and their download is available in the section <mark>‘Benchmark data’</mark>.

### Results, deliverables and dissemination

The results of the tests delivered by the participants will be openly available on the project website, both during and after the end of the project, to download and use (for research, education, testing).

The provided models and their description are also freely available online, permitting future benchmark comparisons.

A detailed report of the results and of their analysis will be written, published on the website and shared with the participants.

Finally, the final results will be published in an open-access journal paper and presented at relevant conferences in the field.

**The most interesting outcomes will be:**

<ol>
	<li>
		<p>A reference list of tools to be used for managing standard 3D models, with their features, performance, including required procedures and settings, clearly described and assessed in a unique framework, and best practices on the use of open standards (OS) in a sample of commonly used software and conversion procedures.</p>
		<p>As the project will identify bottlenecks in the current status of open standard, it will encourage further development and use of OS and increase spatial information interoperability employing semantics and geometry, by providing a framework of tools and solutions for data management and analysis. The report of the benchmark will help to bring the use of OS spatial data further outside the academic world, enhancing the possibility to effectively and actually use complex three (and more)-dimensional data in real-world applications.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>The outline of the present implementation state (how much has been done and how much is left) of spatial OS and feedback about the OS data models to the standardisation entities (OGC and BuildingSmart).</p>
		<p>This will encourage software vendors to implement better support, so that they can be used more effectively in more applications and use cases. The necessary next steps (what is needed in order to implement further or improve the support of OS) will be also outlined.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>GeoBIM benchmark winter school.</p>
		<p>A final <strong>winter school</strong> will be organized at the end of the initiative to present the final results. It will be addressed to students, practitioners from industry and government, other interested parties and it will aim at disseminating the geoBIM topics connected to the benchmark results, and the results themselves. It will be structured as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Educational component: IFC and CityGML OSs;</li>
			<li>Use Case presentation – highlighting situations where geoBIM is useful;</li>
			<li>Presentation of the benchmark and its results;</li>
			<li>Workshop outlining the most effective tools from the benchmark;</li>
			<li>Discussion and feedback, along with plans for future work.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The developed material and test datasets, answers and results analyses, together with the report of the activity describing in detail the material, methods and results of the study, will be made available after the end of the initiative, as reference or material for future improvements, new software tools, tests, continued benchmarking or other similar research.</li>
</ol>
