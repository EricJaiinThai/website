## Overview

Objects of more than three dimensions can be used to model geographic phenomena that occur in space, time and scale.
For instance, a single 4D object can be used to represent the changes in a 3D object's shape across time or all its optimal representations at various levels of detail.

Higher-dimensional objects can be however unintuitive, and extracting meaningful information from them is a challenge.
This research line aims to solve this problem by developing techniques to extract particular 3D city objects from a 4D model.
