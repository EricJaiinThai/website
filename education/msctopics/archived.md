## Automatic thematic and semantic labelling of 3D city models

![](img/semanticenrichment1.png)

Many 3D city models are available as a soup of triangles, i.e. their geometry is not structured as in CityGML. This means that they do not contain semantics, i.e. the geometry of a building is not differentiated from a geometry of a road (above example), and the geometry within the same object (e.g. roof, windows and walls) have the same problem (see the image below, left with the desired result on the right). While such models may still be valuable in visualisation, their use for GIS purposes is hindered by the lack of semantics.

The goal of this thesis is to develop a reasoning system that would automatically infer the theme (semantics) of each geometric primitive, on two levels:

* City level (is it a tree, a building, or a road?)
* City object level (is the geometry a roof, a window, or a wall)?

The solution might involve pattern recognition techniques to aid the classification, hence it can be conducted in collaboration with the [Pattern Recognition Laboratory](http://prlab.tudelft.nl) at TU Delft.
