 <h3>Getting to Delft</h3>



Delft is very easy to reach. It is at a short train ride from Schiphol Amsterdam Airport. In addition, it has very good railway connections to other European countries.

<h4>Through Amsterdam Airport Schiphol</h4>

If you arrive at Amsterdam Airport, you can either take a train to Delft. Trains from the airport to Delft are very comfortable and take approximately 40 minutes. There is a train every 15 minutes. One-way train tickets cost € 8.90 (€ 15.10 for first class). Schiphol railway station can be entered in the main hall of the airport. After clearing customs, you have to go through two rows of shops to get to the main hall. Depending on the train you take to Delft, you will need to go to track 5 or 6. There are ticket windows in the main hall on the side of track 1. Alternatively, you can use the yellow ticket machines in the baggage claim area or in the main hall, which (only at Schiphol Airport) take credit cards.

You should take a train to the main railway station of Delft (not to Delft-Zuid), which is situated between the railway stations Den Haag (The Hague) HS and Rotterdam CS. For the best connections between Schiphol and Delft, you have to change trains in Leiden or Den Haag HS. Trains departing from Schiphol at hh.01 or hh.27 require a change in The Hague to a train to Rotterdam, trains departing at hh.07 or hh.37 require a change in Leiden to a train to Rotterdam. Take care that you don't take a train to Den Haag CS, which is another, terminal station in The Hague, and that you do take a train that stops in Delft (not all trains do). For the train time table, please see the website of Dutch Rail (NS).

For taxis in Delft, please note that because of construction going on in and around Delft railway station, the taxi stand is behind (= on the western side of) the station, on the other side of the blue building you'll see from the platform. When leaving the platform after arriving from Schiphol at the rear end of the train, go down the stairs, turn left, and then left again. After about 100 meters, you will find the taxi stand. You can also use the temporary foot bridge towards the front of the train.

For buses in Delft, please note that because of the construction going on in and around Delft railway station, the bus stop is behind (= on the western side of) the station. For the buses, use the temporary foot bridge towards the front of the train. When you descend the stairs, you'll find the numbers of the buses to TU Delft posted.

Taxis from Schiphol to Delft
A taxi from Schiphol to Delft will cost anywhere between € 79 and € 95 (prices vary, and these are approximate prices). You can book a taxi with the Schiphol Travel Taxi service. On this website, enter 2628 CM as zipcode and 5 as house number (conference venue) or the zipcode and house number of your hotel.

<h4>Through Rotterdam The Hague Airport</h4>

There are direct flights from several European cities to Rotterdam The Hague Airport, which is very close to Delft. A taxi from Rotterdam Airport to Delft will cost around € 25. The telephone number to call a taxi is +31 (0)10-26 20 406. If you prefer to travel to Delft by public transportion, you will first need to take bus nr. 33 to Rotterdam Central Station, which takes about 20 minutes. From there, you can take a direct train to Delft; these run every 15 minutes. See also the website of the RET (local Rotterdam transportation, in Dutch) and Dutch Rail (NS).


<h4>By train</h4>

If you are arriving by train from outside the Netherlands, chances are that you will first arrive to Rotterdam Central Station. From there, you can take a direct train to Delft (a 15 min ride). Please note that Delft has two railway stations (you have to get off at Delft, and not at Delft-Zuid). 


<h4>From the Delft railway station to your hotel</h4>


If you are coming directly to the workshop, the campus of TU Delft is accessible from the train station with the bus no. 69.

<h4>By car</h4>


Delft is easily accessible by car. 
Parking at TU Delft is free in the designated parking lots.
