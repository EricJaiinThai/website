<h4>Through Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS)</h4>

If you arrive at Amsterdam Airport, you can take a direct train to Delft, which is located between the railway stations Den Haag (The Hague) HS and Rotterdam CS. Trains are regular and the ride takes approximately 40 minutes. The train station at Schiphol is located directly under the terminal building. Please note that you should take a train to the main railway station of Delft, and not to Delft-Zuid.

Should you prefer a taxi from Schiphol to Delft, you can book a taxi with the <a href="http://www.schiphol.nl/travellers/tofromschiphol/schipholtraveltaxi.htm">Schiphol Travel Taxi service</a>.
