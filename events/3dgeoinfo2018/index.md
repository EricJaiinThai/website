<p>It is our great pleasure to invite you to the 3D GeoInfo Conference 2018!</p>

<p>The 3D GeoInfo Conference aims at bringing together international researchers from academia, industry and government in the field of 3D geoinformation. The conference offers an interdisciplinary forum to researchers in the fields of data collection, advanced modelling approaches, data analysis and visualisation.</p>

<p>The conference is part of the joint event <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/geodelft2018/">Geo Delft 2018</a>.  The conference will focus on 3D developments and 3D applications in advanced 3D data and technologies. The conference will provide a platform for these topics to be discussed and research ideas exchanged, as well as promote international collaboration in geoinformation, 3D data analysis and visualisations.</p>
