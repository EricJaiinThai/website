* 3D Data Acquisition and Processing
* 3D GIS, Real-Time, Big Data
* 4D/5D Modelling, BIM
* 3D Spatial Databases
* 3D Data Management Systems and Point Cloud

* 3D GeoWeb
* 3D Marine Information Systems

The accepted papers will be published in the ISPRS Annals or the ISPRS Archives, which are both indexed by SCOPUS. Authors of selected papers might be also be invited to extend their paper for possible publication in ISPRS Journals. Prospective authors are encouraged to consider the following possibilities for submission:

* **Full papers** will be published in the *ISPRS Annals* or *ISPRS Archives* after being accepted in a double-blind review. The submitted papers should report new or improved techniques, algorithms, benchmarks, technology developments, frameworks, and best practices, which are not published elsewhere. Papers will be evaluated on their originality, novelty, and impact. Full papers not accepted for *ISPRS Annals* might be considered for the *ISPRS Archives*.

* **Abstracts** will be published in the *ISPRS Archives* after being accepted in a double-blind review and extended into papers. Abstracts on their own will not be published. The submitted (extended) abstracts can be professional/demo papers demonstrating innovative systems and practical approaches, or research in progress.

The papers should be limited to 8 pages and submitted in the [ISPRS template](http://www.isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx).
