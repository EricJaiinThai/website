## Call for papers

We invite you to submit papers related to the following topics:

* 3D Geoinformation Requirements
* 3D Spatial Data Infrastructure & Integration
* 3D Data Acquisition and Processing
* 3D GIS, Real-Time, Big Data
* 4D/5D Modelling, BIM
* 3D Spatial Databases
* 3D Data Management Systems and Point Cloud
* 3D Standards for Geospatial Technologies
* 3D Open Source Development
* 3D City Modelling and CityGML standards
* 3D Geometry, Topology and Semantics
* 3D Data Analysis and Visualisation, Augmented and Virtual Reality
* 3D Spatial Analysis and Simulation
* 3D Modelling for Smart Cities
* 3D Indoor and Outdoor Navigation
* 3D GIS Applications (cadastre, utilities, city and urban planning, geology, disaster and risk management, environmental simulation, archaeology)
* 3D GeoWeb
* 3D Marine Information Systems

There are two options for submissions:

* **Full papers** will be double-blind reviewed. If accepted a full paper will be published in the ISPRS Annals

* Abstracts will be double-blind reviewed. If accepted the authors will have to prepare a paper which will be published in the ISPRS Archives. Abstracts on their own will not be published. 


The accepted papers will be published in the ISPRS Annals or the ISPRS Archives (SCOPUS indexed). Authors of selected papers might be invited to extend their paper for possible publication in ISPRS Journals. Prospective authors are encouraged to consider the following possibilities for submission:

* Papers for ISPRS Annals (Double-blind peer reviewed): Submitted papers should report new or improved techniques, algorithms, bench marks, technology developments, frameworks, and best practices, which are not published elsewhere. Authors are encouraged to submit full papers (max 8 pages) in ISPRS format. Papers will be evaluated on their originality, novelty, and impact. Papers not accepted for ISPRS Annals might be considered for the ISPRS Archives. 

* Papers for ISPRS Archives (Abstract review): Submitted extended abstracts will be published in the ISPRS Archives. Such papers can be professional/demo papers demonstrating innovative systems and practical approaches, or research in progress. Professional/Demo papers are limited to 8 pages in ISPRS format.
